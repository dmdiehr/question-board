I mean it's so cool, it's pink and has rhinestones and it cost like 2000 dollars (I don't really know because I've never had to pay for anything myself my whole life) but I just can't find the cd player and I have this totally awesome vintage cd that I NEED to play. I'll totally be friends with whoever can find it for me (on fb, not forreals lol).",
